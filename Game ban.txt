I thought about it and decided to clear things up for myself.

I played your game every day for a month, completing daily quests to earn credits. Then I noticed a level editor that caught my eye. I experimented with levels and created a farming mode with bots. At the time, I thought only the most experienced players, those who had been playing for a long time, used it. I noticed TheOne online and checking the leaderboards, and I jokingly thought I was about to get banned. And the next morning, I actually was banned. I found out about it on Discord because of my high score in Zombie Survival mode. I was upset and tried to find a way to bypass the ban. I remembered that the game was playable on the website, but I didn't want to start from scratch. So I used the API request getPlayer?username=Diogonal777 to retrieve my data and transfer it to local storage. It worked. I realized that editing a player's save file is very easy. But I didn't want to cheat too much, meaning get tons of credits, experience, and so on. I'm not a cheater; I'm just interested in learning how things work. I lost the desire to just play, so I decided to copy profiles and visit them to see their reactions.
I set my player level/prestige to 9999999 just a couple of times to see how players reacted, knowing I definitely wouldn't make it onto the leaderboards because I couldn't create an account anymore. I literally only visited players at that level a couple of times and didn't play for a long time so as not to interfere. And the last time I logged in at a normal level, I deliberately chose that level.

I understand that I'm at fault, and I'm not the first or last cheater you'll encounter. But please forgive me and unban me from Steam. I don't like the way this looks on my profile.
